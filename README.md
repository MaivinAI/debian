# Maivin Debian Container

This project hosts the source code for the maivin/debian containers which bundle
a Debian distribution with DeepView AI Middleware for use on Maivin and other
compatible platforms.

This container and those built from it are generally compatible with the Debian
containers provided by Toradex: https://github.com/toradex/debian-docker-images
